A cross-platform console-based flash tool for STC-51 microcontrollers.

This software requires my1termu project for serial port interface module, and
my1codelib for simple text-file access. Basic console interface codes are also
provided by my1termu.

I got most (if not all :p) information on STC bootloader interface from
stcdude (deprecated) and stcgal.
